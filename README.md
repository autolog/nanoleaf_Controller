The Autolog nanoleaf Controller  enables you to control [nanoleaf][1] devices directly from Indigo. It enables local LAN control of nanoleaf Devices without having to use an internet connection. It is implemented using Indigo Dimmer Devices to control the nanoleaf devices and fully supporting the new built-in RGBW controls in Indigo 7. In addition to the standard controls, the plugin provides a mechanism to discover nanoleaf devices and to set effects already defined on the nanoleaf device.

The plugin makes extensive use of the code base (modified) of the [nanoleaf library by Software-2][2] for which much thanks are due :)
